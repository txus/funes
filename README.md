# funes

Infer the general shape of data from at least two examples, and optionally
construct a Schema from it.

```
I suspect, nevertheless, that he was not very capable of thought. To think is to
forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of
Funes there were nothing but details, almost contiguous details.

-- from "Funes the Memorious", by Jorge Luis Borges
```

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[funes.core :as f])

(let [data [{:age 20 :name "Funes" :traits [:memorious]}
            {:age 40 :name "Borges" :traits [:writer]}
            {:name "Dog" :breed "doge"}]]
  (f/->schema data))

; {:name                              schema.core/Str
;  (schema.core/optional-key :age)    schema.core/Num
;  (schema.core/optional-key :traits) [(schema.core/enum :writer :memorious)]
;  (schema.core/optional-key :breed)  schema.core/Str}
```

By default, Funes tries to achieve a good tradeoff between generalization and
concreteness. If you need deeper control into that, you can use the pieces
yourself. The above call to `(f/->schema data)` evaluates to:

```clojure
(require '[funes.schema :as s])

(->> data
     (reduce f/infer)
     s/generalize-values ;; you can skip this part if you want maximum concreteness
     s/generate-schema)
```

## What about clojure.spec?

Funes is in no way coupled to `prismatic/schema`. The namespace that generates
schemas is `funes.schema`, and it's just 100 lines of code describing a
compilear from Funes' internal AST to Schema, but it should be equally trivial
to compile to `clojure.spec`. I'd like to to that soon, but feel free to give it
a go if you'd like!
